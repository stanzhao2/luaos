LuaSQL
http://keplerproject.github.io/luasql

LuaSQL is a simple interface from Lua to a DBMS. It enables a Lua program to:

    * Connect to ODBC, ADO, Oracle, MySQL, SQLite, Firebird and PostgreSQL databases; 
    * Execute arbitrary SQL statements;
    * Retrieve results in a row-by-row cursor fashion.

LuaSQL is free software and uses the same license as Lua 5.1. 


Source code for LuaSQL can be downloaded from its GitHub repository.
